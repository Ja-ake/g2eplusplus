Needed:
- easy way of adding static objects to a world
	- eventually add "chunks" of data
		- drawing speed increase
		- memory usage optimization
		- physics is faster
		- eliminates need for kd-trees (which are hard)
- dynamic objects
	- simple objects that exist as a movable entity
	- skeletons
